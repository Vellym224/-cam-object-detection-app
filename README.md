# web-cam-object-detection-app
My object detection application is based on TensorFlow object detection API, a framework for creating deep learning networks that solve object detection problem. There are already trained models
for which you can build your own model as well or train by using Deep learning networks in TensorFlow where every node is a transformation of its inputs. They are layers of Convolutional networks and MaxPooling features. The result of training is a binary file contains both topology and weights of the trained network.
